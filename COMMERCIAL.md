RelayCraft is proudly open-source under the **AGPLv3** license. This ensures the project remains free and open for the community while providing a sustainable path for its continued development.

## Licensing Models

We offer a **Dual Licensing** model to accommodate both open-source collaboration and proprietary commercial needs.

| Feature | Open Source (AGPLv3) | Commercial License |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Cost** | Free | Paid |
| **Source Code Availability** | **Must remain open** (if modified & served) | **Private / Closed Source** |
| **Usage** | Personal, Open Source, Non-profit | Enterprise, Proprietary Products |
| **Modifications** | Must be shared back to community | Can be kept proprietary |
| **Support** | Community (GitHub Issues) | Priority Email / Slack Support |
| **License Compatibility** | Incompatible with closed-source projects | Compatible with proprietary code |

### 1. Open Source (AGPLv3)
RelayCraft is free for personal use, educational purposes, and for developers working on open-source projects.
- **Requirement**: If you modify RelayCraft and provide it as a service over a network (SaaS), you **must** make your source code available under the same AGPLv3 license.
- **Ideal for**: Individual developers, students, researchers, and open-source contributors.

### 2. Commercial License
If your organization wishes to use RelayCraft without the restrictions of AGPLv3 (e.g., integrating it into a proprietary product, modifying it for internal use without disclosure, or bundling it with closed-source software), we offer a **Commercial License**.

**Benefits:**
- **No AGPLv3 restrictions**: Keep your integrations and modifications private.
- **Legal Assurance**: Detailed license agreement tailored for enterprise compliance.
- **Priority Support**: Direct access to the core development team.
- **Feature Influence**: Prioritize features on the roadmap that matter to your business.
